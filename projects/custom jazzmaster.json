    "description": "This Warmoth Jazzmaster kit started out as a high school graduation present from my dad. Much to his dismay, it wouldn't be painted until my senior year of college, and wouldn't make a sound until earlier this year. I think we're in agreement that the final product was worth the wait. Really, the only thing that betrays the fact that an 18-year-old had anything to do with it is the sharkfin fret inlays. (But they're growing on me).",
    "features": "Technically speaking, it's an Alder body painted with oils (which had to dry for six months before any sealer could be applied), two Seymour Duncan P-90s, and a hand-built Bill Lawrence single coil pickup in the middle position. Some of the design elements come from the earliest map of my hometown that I could find (approximately 1873)."
