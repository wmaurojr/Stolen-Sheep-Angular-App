    "description": "Name Brand Overstock is a NYC-based retailer with an e-commerce store and a brick-and-mortar shop in lower Manhattan. I set out to make their logo quickly recognizable, versatile, and scalable. The 'R' and 'C' worked out well, both in their placement as well as in the fact that they can be used as an icon.",
