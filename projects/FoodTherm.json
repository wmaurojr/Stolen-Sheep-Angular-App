    "description": "Food science--especially the hardware--is starting to get really interesting. Sou vide, steam ovens, anti-griddles; it'll be interesting to see what starts to show up in home kitchens in the next decade or so. When I was approached about the FoodTherm logo design, I came to this after ditching a bunch of low-hanging thermometer-based imagery. I like that this gets down to the elusive balance involved in finding the perfect temperature.",
