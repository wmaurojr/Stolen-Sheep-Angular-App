    "description": "This project was a chance to work with friend and Jedi developer Jon Freynik (http://www.headslab.com). Arc Electric has field-reps that have to build extensive work orders in locations like warehouses or factories where wi-fi is scarce. Jon created an Angular.js app that stores data in a local database until the rep gets to a wi-fi connection, where their work order will be added to the 'communal' database. My task was to provide an intuitive UI for navigating and drafting work orders that could work on a range of mobile devices. I'm told the client was thrilled with the end result, and I loved the excuse to work directly with Jon (whose moves I'm continually trying to steal)."
