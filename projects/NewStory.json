    "description": "NewStory.com was both challenging and rewarding. With 11 locations scattered throughout Pennsylvania and Ohio, New Story needed a site that offered the abilities to aggregate information from the various sites, unify their brand across disparate schools each with its own offerings, and keep the look lighthearted and colorful.",
    "features": "NewStory.com afforded me my first opportunity to develop with Wordpress Multi-site. Each school can post jobs and events to the 'main' site while displaying proprietary information at a unique subdomain. I used Elliot Condon's Advanced Custom Fields extensively throughout the site to make updates intuitive for administrators; they can swap banners, select icons, even populate a custom jQuery tabs template all from the Dashboard.",
