    "description": "I'm not a 'Trekkie', and certainly don't condone violence (toward women OR men in rubber suits), but when a friend recommended I watch the first Star Trek series, I couldn't help but notice a trend: just like the plots, the violence relies pretty heavily on the suspension of disbelief. This tongue-in-cheek infographic was my attempt at matching 60's Star Trek blow for blow: absurd, dripping with machismo, and in the end fun to look at.",
    "features": "This wasn't always fun to make, however; I ended up going through a lot of episodes looking for really specific screenshots before sicking the pen-tool on them. You can see a few in-progress shots here and the original idea I had for the composition, with the Nerdship Enterprise taking up a little too much real estate."
