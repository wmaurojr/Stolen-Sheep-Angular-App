"description": "I designed this Wordpress site for Philadelphia-based personal trainer and owner of Goalsfit, Kasey Manwaring. She wanted something bold, responsive, and easy-to-navigate, and the site strayed very little from my original designs. Kasey was a blast to work with and when Goalsfit gyms start to pop up all over the East coast, I hope she'll remember me.",
"features": "Goalsfit.com is fully responsive, features a custom Google Map to match the styling of the site, and a pretty handsome contact form (if I do say so myself).",
