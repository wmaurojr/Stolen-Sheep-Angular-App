    "features": "This is one of the older pieces in my portfolio, but I don't know that I'll ever take it out. I was fresh out of college and bright-eyed when DiSalvo's hired me to do this, and I think seeing a painting that started out in my apartment get blown up and plastered on a billboard gave me 'the bug'.",
    "description": "DiSalvo's wanted a unique billboard to celebrate a new relationship with Pedro's Wine Collection in time for the holidays. When I suggested something not only vintage but handmade, they were all for it. I still felt I had to impose my time in art school on anyone and everyone, but I think fine dining and wine are high-brow enough to warrant an Alphonse Mucha nod (though I probably would have tried painting this for a rib shack)."
