    "description": "Photographer Eric Beiter is the man behind Highland Photography Studio and already had some ideas in mind when he approached me about creating a logo. He knew he wanted to feature mountains as they're part of the inspiration for both the company's name and many of his photographs.",
    "features": "Sometimes--though not that often--the planets align and everything just seems to fall into place with a logo. My first idea was the set below, using the corner of the camera to lend its shape to the mountains, but it didn't feel balanced. I like the final product, as it's more subtle and focuses on the idea of the photograph and not the equipment. Fortunately for me, Eric agreed and uses the burgundy colored-version for all of his branding.",
