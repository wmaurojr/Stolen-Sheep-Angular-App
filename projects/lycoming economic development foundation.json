    "description": "I'd love to say that both the concept and the visual for this design came to me simultaneously, but it just wasn't so. I was toying around with the image of a building in 3-point perspective when I noticed the likness to a squared-off pie-chart. The fact that those two images just so happen to lend themselves perfectly to a foundation whose sole purpose is providing the last piece of the financial puzzle for growing businesses? A much appreciated windfall."
